To run this you will need to use Eclipse with Java 21

We successfully read a vehicleList.csv file into our program which is a collection of information for various vehicles. When ran, the program will allow users to:

-Print the list of all vehicles and their information\n
-Print vehicles based on the type of vehicle (car, SUV, motorbike, truck) they wish to obtain information about\n 
-Get information on what the highest and lowest maintenance cost vehicles are\n
-Get information on which are the highest and lowest on their fuel efficiency\n
-Get the average fuel efficiencies of SUVs in the list\n
-Get the number of vehicles in list by type (car, SUV, motorbike, truck)\n
-Add and remove vehicles from the list\n
-Save any changes made to the list of vehicles\n

*It should be noted that extra methods were added into the project for testing purposes*
