To run this you will need to use Eclipse with Java 21

We successfully read a vehicleList.csv file into our program which is a collection of information for various vehicles. When ran, the program will allow users to:

+Print the list of all vehicles and their information
+Print vehicles based on the type of vehicle (car, SUV, motorbike, truck) they wish to obtain information about
+Get information on what the highest and lowest maintenance cost vehicles are
+Get information on which are the highest and lowest on their fuel efficiency
+Get the average fuel efficiencies of SUVs in the list
+Get the number of vehicles in list by type (car, SUV, motorbike, truck)
+Add and remove vehicles from the list
+Save any changes made to the list of vehicles

*It should be noted that extra methods were added into the project for testing purposes*
